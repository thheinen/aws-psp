           "Subproperty `GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds` is not a Integer" => lambda { |v| v[:GameSessionActivationTimeoutSeconds].is_a? Integer },
         },
         description: <<~'DESCRIPTION'
           Instructions for launching server processes on each instance in the fleet. Server processes run either a custom game build executable or a Realtime script. The runtime configuration defines the server executables or launch script file, launch parameters, and the number of processes to run concurrently on each instance. When creating a fleet, the runtime configuration must have at least one server process configuration; otherwise the request fails with an invalid request exception.
            This parameter is required unless the parameters ServerLaunchPath and ServerLaunchParameters are defined. Runtime configuration has replaced these parameters, but fleets that use them will continue to work.
         DESCRIPTION

property :script_id, String,

         description: <<~'DESCRIPTION'
           A unique identifier for a Realtime script to be deployed on a new Realtime Servers fleet. The script must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
            Note: It is not currently possible to use the !Ref command to reference a script created with a CloudFormation template for the fleet property ScriptId. Instead, use Fn::GetAtt Script.Arn or Fn::GetAtt Script.Id to retrieve either of these properties as input for ScriptId. Alternatively, enter a ScriptId string manually.
         DESCRIPTION

property :server_launch_parameters, String,
         callbacks: {

         },
         description: <<~'DESCRIPTION'
           This parameter is no longer used but is retained for backward compatibility. Instead, specify server launch parameters in the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. A request must specify either a runtime configuration or values for both ServerLaunchParameters and ServerLaunchPath.
         DESCRIPTION

property :server_launch_path, String,
         callbacks: {

         },
         description: <<~'DESCRIPTION'
           This parameter is no longer used. Instead, specify a server launch path using the RuntimeConfiguration parameter. Requests that specify a server launch path and launch parameters instead of a runtime configuration will continue to work.
